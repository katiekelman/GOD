            Entries are now closed. A BIG thank you to all of you who have taken
            part and everyone who has encouraged and helped them to do so. The
            quality and number of entries has overwhelmed me and it has given us
            enormous pleasure each day seeing what has arrived by email. Some of
            the paintings have shown a skill that would be acceptable in any
            open art competition. Many have made us laugh. Some have made us
            speechless. A lot of them tell a wonderful story and most have been
            done by people determined not to put off by age, illness or
            disability.
