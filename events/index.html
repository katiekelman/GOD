          <p>
            In this “year of the lockdown” we are giving a prize for the best
            artwork entitled “Happy Times” produced by an artist over the age of
            90 at the end of August this year. The pictures must be 2D (flat),
            but can be in any media – pencil, charcoal, crayon, watercolour,
            acrylic, oils, collage, digital – or a mixture of the whole lot if
            you are feeling especially disgraceful!

            <h1>The Rules</h1>
            <ul>
              • The competition is open to all UK citizens who are over 90 on
              31st August 2020
              <br />
              • Each person may only submit one work of art that has been
              created in 2020.
              <br />
              • We must receive the entries for the competition by 31 August
              2020. We will let you know by the middle of September if your
              picture has been shortlisted.
              <br />
              • The final winner will be announced by the end of September and
              will receive £200 and a tree of their choice to be planted near
              their home.
              <br />
              • When taking a photo of your artwork to send to us, please make
              sure you use natural lighting. Dark or unnatural light can result
              in odd-looking images.
              <br />
              • We will supply a young sapling and, with the agreement of the
              winner, arrange for it to be planted in a suitable place. It will
              be up to the winner, together with the owner of the site, to
              decide what sort of tree they would like.
              <br />
              • The Grow Old Disgracefully Trust reserves the right to cancel
              the competition at any time, if deemed necessary or if
              circumstances arise outside of our control.
              <br />
              • The competition will be entirely online. You do not need to send
              us the original.
            <br />
              • Read Terms and Conditions <a href="/terms">here</a>.
