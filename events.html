        <h2>Grow Old Disgracefully Art Prize for artists over 90 years of age.</h2>
        <article>
          <h3>
          In this “year of the lockdown” we are giving a prize for the best artwork entitled “Happy Times” produced by an artist
          over the age of 90 at the end of August this year. The pictures must be 2D (flat), but can be in any media – pencil,
          charcoal, crayon, watercolour, acrylic, oils, collage – or a mixture of the whole lot if your are feeling especially
          disgraceful!
          
          The best 20 entries will be shortlisted and displayed on our website in the middle of September and the winner will be
          announced by the end of September.

          </h3>
          <p>
          To Enter
          
          Just email a photo of your artwork to competitions@growolddisgracefully.co.uk with the heading Happy Times. You also
          need to tell us your name, your age at the end of August, the size of the picture and the media you use.

          </p>
