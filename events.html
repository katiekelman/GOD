            In this “year of the lockdown” we are giving a prize for the best
            artwork entitled “Happy Times” produced by an artist over the age of
            90 at the end of August this year. The pictures must be 2D (flat),
            but can be in any media – pencil, charcoal, crayon, watercolour,
            acrylic, oils, collage, digital – or a mixture of the whole lot if
            you are feeling especially disgraceful! <br />
          </p>
        </div>
        <p id="art2">
          The best 20 entries will be shortlisted and displayed on our website
          in the middle of September and the winner will be announced by the end
          of September.

            with the heading Happy Times. You also need to tell us your name,

          <h1>The Rules</h1>
          <ul>
            • The competition is open to all UK citizens who are over 90 on 31st
            August 2020
            <br />

            • Each person may only submit one work of art that has been created
            in 2020.
            <br />

            • We must receive the entries for the competition by 31 August 2020.
            We will let you know by the middle of September if your picture has
            been shortlisted.
            <br />

            • The final winner will be announced by the end of September and
            will receive £200 and a tree of their choice to be planted near
            their home.
            <br />

            • When taking a photo of your artwork to send to us, please make
            sure you use natural lighting. Dark or unnatural light can result in
            odd-looking images.
            <br />

            • We will supply a young sapling and, with the agreement of the
            winner, arrange for it to be planted in a suitable place. It will be
            up to the winner, together with the owner of the site, to decide
            what sort of tree they would like.
            <br />

            • The Grow Old Disgracefully Trust reserves the right to cancel the
            competition at any time, if deemed necessary or if circumstances
            arise outside of our control.
            <br />

            • The competition will be entirely online. You do not need to send
            us the original.
