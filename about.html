          As a charity we work closely with the National Activity Providers
          Association. They are a great organisation that helps care teams with
          training, ideas and help. Their aim is to “assist every care and
          support setting to be full of life, love and laughter”.

          We sponsor an annual award to the resident of a care facility who have
          been helped and encouraged by their carers to do something “outrageous
          or with a fabulous twist that defies expectations.” The achievements
          in the past winners have been truly amazing and produced some
          wonderful role models for elderly people

          This year, in addition to that award, we are organising an art
          competition for the over 90s. The winner will receive the Grow Old
          Disgracefully Art Prize which will consist of £500 and a tree of their
          choice to be planted near their home. Details of how to enter for this
          competition will be posted on this site in the next few weeks.
