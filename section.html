    In this “year of the lockdown” we are giving a prize for the best artwork
    entitled “Happy Times” produced by an artist over the age of 90 at the end
    of August this year. The pictures must be 2D (flat), but can be in any media
    – pencil, charcoal, crayon, watercolour, acrylic, oils, collage, digital –
    or a mixture of the whole lot if you are feeling especially disgraceful!
